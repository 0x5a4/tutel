# 0.2.8
More of a maintenance release, focusing on cleanup and very minor improvements.

## What's changed?
- `tutel` now support dynamic shell completions thanks to [bpaf](https://github.com/pacak/bpaf).
    If you type something like `tutel done <TAB>` you will be offered a list of possible Tasks
    you might want to refer to. This cuts down on running `tutel` all the time in order to 
    see what index that god damn task had.
- Minor, but important refactoring of the code base 

## What's to come?
- Due Dates, at the moment I'm unsure how to properly implement them though
- Sub categories through placing files in sub-directories. Once again, I'm unsure how to
    properly implement them.
