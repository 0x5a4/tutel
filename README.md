*a little bonus*
All your projects and their locations are bookmarked in a per user file.
You can directly go there by using ```tutelnav <name>```.

For this to work you need to add a line to your shell config:
```
fish(config.fish):
tutel init fish | source

bash(.bashrc):
eval "$(tutel init bash)"
```
